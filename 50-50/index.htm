					dominant publishing platforms (ex. Squarespace, Wordpress) shaped the
					way we use the web? What is the difference between the handmade web
					and the corporate web? What is the importance of writing alt text as
					poetry? How can web designers grow by learning to think
					algorithmically through code?
