			<div>
				The div element has no special meaning at all. It was once used to
				create multi-column layouts, back in the early 2000s when no other
				options existed in CSS. Authors are strongly encouraged to view the div
				element as an element of last resort, for when no other element is
				suitable. Use of more appropriate elements instead of the div element
				leads to better accessibility for readers and easier maintainability for
				authors.
