					<h5><pre>></pre> OVERVIEW</h5>
				</span>
				<p>
					This guide outlines the steps to move your website away from wix.com
				</p>
				<p>
					It covers the main steps of transferring your domain and implementing one of the website templates with your content.
				</p>

				<span>
					<h5><pre>></pre> TEMPLATES</h5>
				</span>
				<p>
					I've created three 1-page websites to use in place of your wix web design. These templates are meant to be transitional to get your work back online as soon as possible, though you are welcome to use them for as long as needed.
				</p>
				<p>
					<a href="https://rupalimo.github.io/bds-wix/paragraph-text/" target="_blank" title="template #1">template #1</a> is
					designed to accommodate most ppl, highlighting important information
					and key links, with the option of including horizontally scrolling images /
					<a href="https://rupalimo.github.io/bds-wix/50-50/" target="_blank" title="template #2">template #2</a> would
					likely be best for organizations, writers, non-visual practices in
					general /
					<a href="https://rupalimo.github.io/bds-wix/img-on-hover/" target="_blank" title="template #3">template #3</a> is
					almost completely image-based with a few important links listed, best for photographers, ppl in fashion, performance, graphic designers etc.
				</p>
				<p>If you are looking for alternatives to wix.com, i have some friends who use and enjoy
					<a href="">cargocollective</a>, <a href="">squarespace</a> but there are others out there to look up.</p>

				<span

						COST

				<p>This is a mostly free solution...</p>
				<p>
					YES you will need to continue paying for your custom domain, usually less than
					$30/yr depending on the domain name registrar you use

				<h3 class="title">ENDING YOUR WIX.COM SUBSCRIPTION</h3>
				<span>
					<h5><pre>></pre> REVIEW PAYMENT PERIOD</h5>
					<h5></h5>
				</span>
				<p>
					It's a good idea to check when your subscription period ends,
					unfortunately wix does not refund any $$ for cancelling early.
				</p>
			
					<p>As well, make sure you have turned off the auto renew to your wix subscription and if possible remove/cancel your 'premium' subscription.</p>

					<span

						Archiving YOUR WORK
					</h5>
					<h5>(10minutes)</h5></span
				>
				<p>
					Transferring your domain away from wix will remove your current
					website as you have designed it from being available to view online.
				</p>
				<p>
					To avoid losing the work you have put into your design, i encourage making a local copy of the
					documents, image files, and links used before starting the domain transfer.
				</p>
				<p>This might look like,</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Organizing logo, image, video, and/or audio files and labelling
						them according to their website organization
					</li>
					<li>
						Copy/pasting accompanying text and externally linked websites and
						files in a locally saved document
					</li>
					<li>
						Noting any colour codes and font choices you may want to use in the
						future
					</li>
					<li>
						Consider taking screenshots and screen recordings of your website
						for reference
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Though this step isn't necessary it might be helpful when you start buidling your website on another platform.</p>

					<p>
					Your domain registered with wix will only be taken offline after you officially

						>'Transfer Away from Wix'</a
					>
					and use the authorization code provided to confirm this transfer
					<em>...more on this later</em>
				</p>
				<p>As soon as the domain transfer process is started, your official website (under the wix premium subscription) will be taken offline. Unfortunately, wix does not allow users to delete their account and instead defaults it back to the 'free' version, meaning that your website will remain online at the wix URL [<em>accountname</em>.wixsite.com/<em>siteaddress</em>] until the end of your subscription period.</p>
				<p>It is unlikely that anyone will be searching for your website using this wix specific URL, but i would encourage removing all of your work (after saving locally) from your wix account so that is no longer available for wix to host.</p>

				<h3>setting up a GitHub account</h3>
				<p class="note">NOTE</p>
				<p class="note--text">If you haven't used <a href="https://github.com/" title="GitHub.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a> before, it is free to sign up and offers free hosting to <em>public repositories</em>, which is how we will be hosting your -bds wix- website. A <em>public repository</em> means that the source code (html, css, js etc) used to create the website is made freely available for other GitHub users ...basically to keep things <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source" target="_blank" title="open source wikipedia">open source</a>.</p>
				<span>
					<h5><pre>></pre> make an account</h5>
					<h5>10minutes</h5>
				</span>
				<p>If you already have an account, please skip this and move to the next</p>
				<p>OR</p>
				<p>If you do not already have an account, please follow the steps to make your account</p>
				<span>
					<h5><pre>></pre> create a new repository</h5>
					<h5>10minutes</h5>
				</span>
				<p>A <em>repository</em> is essentially a folder for organizing and uploading all files to do with your website. This may include, the source code of the chosen website template, image files, and additional font files.</p>
				<p>Use <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository" target="_blank">this</a> step-by-step guide to create a new repository for your new bds-wix website. Skip steps 2 - 4, and jump ahead to step 5-- i recommend naming your repository 'bdswix-<em>YourName</em>', replacing 'YourName' with your actual name. Make sure your repository is set to 'public' and click 'Create Repository'</p>
				<p>On the next page, select the top right option reading, 'Add collaborators to this repository'. Please click the button below labelled, 'Invite collaborators' and search my username 'rupalimo', confirming by selecting the 'Add' button.</p>
				<p>That's all you do for now, by adding me as a collaborator, i am able to add the website files to your GitHub account and later help connect it to your domain.</p>

				<h3>transferring your domain</h3>
				
					<p class="note">NOTE</p>
					<p class="note--text">
						Your custom domain www.<em>name</em>.com may include or exclude the
						<em>www.</em> and end in a variety of ways, <em>.com</em> being the
						most common.
					</p>
				</div>

				<span>
					<h5><pre>></pre> Where did you originally purchase ur Domain ?</h5>
					<h5>(10minutes)</h5>
				</span>
				<p>
					If you purchased your domain several years ago and don't remember where, use <a href="https://who.is/" target="_blank" title="check registrar info regarding your custom domain">whois.com</a> to search for your domain name registrar. Some popular examples being<em> GoDaddy, BlueHost, DreamHost, NameCheap, Google Domains, Network Solutions...</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					After you've figured out where you purchased ur domain, you will need to login and/or troubleshoot logging in to get access to your account. This might require getting in touch with the customer services.
				</p>
				<p>OR</p>
				<p>If wix is your first website ever, it is very likely you purchased your custom domain directly from wix. In this case, you will need to choose a domain name register (mentioned above) to transfer your wix domain to. I recommend looking through the domain registrar options and read some reviews-- the transfer process is free but registrar's will charge you a one-year extension of your domain. The pricing of which will vary slightly across domain registrars and on your domain name (for instance if it ends in <em>.com</em> or <em>.net</em> or <em>.org</em> this will influence the cost). You can find an approximate cost for each domain registrar by searching "domain transfer fee [name of domain registrar]" but it should be less than $30 a year.
				</p>
				<p>OR</p>
				<p>If you don't have a custom domain and are using wix under the free user subscription, you don't have to worry about this! Contact me if you would like to purchase a domain and connect it to one of these templates (but this is not necessary)</p>

					<h5><pre>></pre> Confirming Transfer</h5>
					<h5>(5minutes)</h5>
				</span>
				<p class="note">NOTE</p>
				<p class="note--text">Please read through the steps below before beginning. We are officially starting the <em>domain transfer</em> process which will remove your wix website. The transfer of your domain from wix to your domain registrar takes 5-7 days to process, during which time your website will be offline.</p>
		
				<p>You should receive a code from wix.com at the email associated with your wix account. This code needs to be entered at your domain name registrar. See these detailed steps according to your registrar, . If you have ur domain at another platform, search "Transfer domain to [<em>name of domain registrar</em>]", it should be relatively straightforward.</p>
				<p>Remember that if you purchased your domain directly from wix you will need to pay a "transfer fee". In any case, DO NOT purchase any hosting add ons, this is entirely unnecessary!</p>
