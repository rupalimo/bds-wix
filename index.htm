				<h3 class="title">ABOUT BDS-WIX TEMPLATES</h3>
				<span><h5><pre>></pre> OVERVIEW</h5></span>
				<p>This guide outlines the steps to move your website away from wix.com<br>It covers the technical stuff like how to transfer your domain and how to implement one of the website templates with your content.</p>

				<span><h5><pre>></pre> TEMPLATES</h5></span>
				<p>I created three 1-page website templates to use as a transitional stepping stone while you figure out which website thing to do next <a href="">cargocollective</a>, <a href="">squarespace</a> etc</p>
				<p>They are limited to text, images, and hyperlinks...</p>
					<a href="" target="_blank" title="template #1">template #1</a> is designed to accommodate most ppl, emphasizing important information and links, and option of including images /
					<a href="" target="_blank" title="template #2">template #2</a> would likely be best for organizations, writers, non-visual practices in general /
					<a href="" target="_blank" title="template #3">template #3</a> is almost completely image-based with a few important links listed</p>
					
				<span><h5><pre>></pre> PAYMENTS</h5></span>
				<p>This is a mostly free solution...</p>
				<p>YES you will need to keep paying for your custom domain, less than $30/yr depending on the domain name registrar you use <em><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/en-ca/domains/domain-transfer">GoDaddy</a>, <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9175/83/how-to-transfer-a-domain/">Namecheap</a>, <a href="https://www.bluehost.com/help/article/transfer-your-domain-to-us">BlueHost</a>, <a href="https://porkbun.com/transfer">porkbun</a> <a href="" title="domain registrar search">etc.</a></em>
				</p>
				<p>NO you will not need to pay for hosting (keeping your website online)</p>

				<h3 class="title">ENDING YOUR WIX.COM SUBSCRIPTION</h3>
			
				<span
					><h5><pre>></pre> REVIEW PAYMENT PERIOD & YOUR BUDGET</h5>
					<h5></h5></span
				>
				<p>
					It's a good idea to check when your subscription period ends, unfortunately wix does not refund any $$ for cancelling early.
				</p>
				<p>
					Your wix website will only be taken offline after you officially <a href="" target="_blank" title="info on transferring away from wix">'Transfer Away from Wix'</a> and use the authorization code provided to confirm this transfer <em>...more on this later</em>
				</p>

				<span><h5><pre>></pre> Archiving YOUR WORK</h5><h5>(10minutes)</h5></span>
				<p>
					Ending your hosting services with wix.com will remove
					your current website including ALL uploaded files, text, and links.
				</p>
				<p>
					To avoid losing any work, make sure to create a local copy of all
					documents, images, and links before making any changes to your wix
					subscription.
				</p>
				<p>
					This might look like,
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
				Downloading all logo, image, video, and/or audio files and labelling them according to their website organization
				</li>
				<li>
				Copy/pasting accompanying text and externally linked websites and files in a locally saved document
				</li>
				<li>
				Noting any colour codes and font choices you may want to use in the future
				</li>
				<li>
				Consider taking screenshots and screen recordings of your website
				for reference
				</li>

				</ul>
