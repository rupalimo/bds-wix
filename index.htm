				<span><h5>> OVERVIEW</h5></span>
				<p>This guide outlines the steps to move your website away from wix.com, no matter what your computer experience.</p>
				<p>It covers the technical stuff like how to transfer your domain, and how to implement one of the website templates with your content.</p>
				<p>If you have the time, </p>
				<span><h5>> TEMPLATES</h5></span>
				<p>I created three 1-page website templates to use as a transitional stepping stone while you figure out which website thing to do next <a href="">cargocollective</a>, <a href="">squarespace</a> etc</p>
				<span><h5>> PAYMENTS</h5></span>
				<p>This is a mostly free solution, 
					<ul>
						<li>YES you will need to keep paying for your custom domain-- though this should cost less than $30/yr depending on the domain name registrar you use <em><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/en-ca/domains/domain-transfer">GoDaddy</a>, <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9175/83/how-to-transfer-a-domain/">Namecheap</a>, <a href="https://www.bluehost.com/help/article/transfer-your-domain-to-us">BlueHost</a>, <a href="https://porkbun.com/transfer">porkbun</a></em></li>
						<li>NO you will not need to pay for hosting (keeping your website online)</li>
					</ul> you can find for hosting (making your website alive online), the templates exist on a <a href="#">github.com</a>, where eventually you will make an account

				<h3 class="title">ENDING YOUR WIX.COM SUBSCRIPTION</h3>
			
				<span
					><h5>> REVIEW PAYMENT PERIOD & YOUR BUDGET</h5>
					<h5></h5></span
				>
				<p>
					It's a good idea to check when your subscription period is ending to track what you might end up having to pay if you are stopping earlier in your plan.

					<h5>> SAVING YOUR WORK</h5><h5>(10minutes)</h5>
					</span>
				<p>
					Ending your subscription and hosting services with wix.com will remove
					your current website, including all uploaded files, text, and links.
				</p>
				<p>
					To avoid losing any work, make sure to create a local copy of all
					documents, images, and links before making any changes to your wix
					subscription.This might look like,
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Downloading all logo, image, video, and/or audio files, taking a
						moment to organize and label files according to their website
						organization
					</li>
					<li>
						Copy/pasting accompanying text and externally linked websites and
						files integrated
					</li>
					<li>
						Consider taking screenshots and/or screen recordings of your website
						for future reference
					</li>
				</ul>

				</div>

				<span
					><h5>> Check Where You Purchased Your Custom Domain</h5>
					<h5>(10minutes)</h5></span

				<p>

						>whois.com</a
