				<span>
					<h5><pre>></pre>OVERVIEW</h5>
				</span>
				<p>
					This guide outlines the steps to move your website away from wix.com
				</p>
				<p>
					It covers the main steps of transferring your domain and implementing one of the website templates with your content.
				</p>

				<span>
					<h5><pre>></pre>TEMPLATES</h5>
				</span>
				<p>
					I've created three 1-page website templates to use in place of your wix web design. The templates are meant to be transitional to keep you work online during this -moving- period, though you are welcome to use them for as long as needed.
				</p>
				<p>
					<a href="" target="_blank" title="template #1">template #1</a> is
					designed to accommodate most ppl, emphasizing important information
					and links, and option of including images /
					<a href="" target="_blank" title="template #2">template #2</a> would
					likely be best for organizations, writers, non-visual practices in
					general /
					<a href="" target="_blank" title="template #3">template #3</a> is
					almost completely image-based with a few important links listed
				</p>
				<p>If you are looking for alternatives to wix.com, i have some friends who use and enjoy
					<a href="">cargocollective</a>, <a href="">squarespace</a> but there are others out there to look up.</p>

				<span
					><h5>
						<pre>></pre>
						COST

				<p>This is a mostly free solution...</p>
				<p>
					YES you will need to continue paying for your custom domain, usually less than
					$30/yr depending on the domain name registrar you use

			<section>
				<h3 class="title">ENDING YOUR WIX.COM SUBSCRIPTION</h3>
				<span>
					<h5><pre>></pre> REVIEW PAYMENT PERIOD</h5>
					<h5></h5>
				</span>
				<p>
					It's a good idea to check when your subscription period ends,
					unfortunately wix does not refund any $$ for cancelling early.
				</p>
			
					<p>As well, make sure you have turned off the auto renew to your wix subscription and if possible remove/cancel your 'premium' subscription.</p>

					<span>
					<h5><pre>></pre> WIX FINE PRINT</h5>
					<h5></h5>
				</span>
					<p>
					Your domain registered with wix will only be taken offline after you officially
					<a href="" target="_blank" title="info on transferring away from wix"
						>'Transfer Away from Wix'</a
					>
					and use the authorization code provided to confirm this transfer
					<em>...more on this later</em>
				</p>
				<p>After the domain transfer process is confirmed, your official website (under the wix premium subscription) will be taken offline. Unfortunately, wix does not allow users to delete their account, instead defaulting it back to the 'free' version. meaning that your website will remain online at the wix URL <em>accountname</em>.wixsite.com/<em>siteaddress</em> until the end of your subscription period</p>
				<p>It is unlikely that anyone will be searching for your website using this wix URL, but i would encourage removing all of your work from your wix account so that is no longer available for wix to host.</p>

						Archiving YOUR WORK
					</h5>
					<h5>(10minutes)</h5></span
				>
				<p>
					Ending your hosting services with wix.com will remove your current
					website including ALL uploaded files, text, and links.
				</p>
				<p>
					To avoid losing any work, make sure to create a local copy of all
					documents, images, and links before making any changes to your wix
					subscription.
				</p>
				<p>This might look like,</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Downloading all logo, image, video, and/or audio files and labelling
						them according to their website organization
					</li>
					<li>
						Copy/pasting accompanying text and externally linked websites and
						files in a locally saved document
					</li>
					<li>
						Noting any colour codes and font choices you may want to use in the
						future
					</li>
					<li>
						Consider taking screenshots and screen recordings of your website
						for reference
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>setting up a GitHub account</h3>
				<p class="note">NOTE</p>
				<p>If you haven't used <a href="" title="GitHub.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a> before, it is free to sign up and offers free hosting to <em>public repositories</em>, which is how we will be hosting your -bds wix- website. A <em>public repository</em> means that the source code (html, css, js etc) used to create the website is made freely available for other GitHub users ...basically to keep things <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source" target="_blank" title="open source wikipedia">open source</a>.</p>

					<h5><pre>></pre> Where did you originally purchase ur Domain ?</h5>
					<h5>(10minutes)</h5>
				</span>
				<p>
					If you purchased your domain several years ago and don't remember where, use <a href="https://who.is/" target="_blank" title="check registrar info regarding your custom domain">whois.com</a> to search for your domain name registrar. Some popular examples being<em> GoDaddy, BlueHost, DreamHost, NameCheap, Google Domains, Network Solutions...</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					After you've figured out where you purchased ur domain, you will need to login and/or troubleshoot logging in to get acccess to your account. This might require getting in touch with the customer services.
				</p>
				<p>---</p>
				<p>If wix is your first website ever, it is very likely you purchased your custom domain directly from wix.
				</p>
				<p>---</p>
				<p>If you don't have a custom domain and are using wix under the free user subscription, you don't have to worry about this! Contact me if you would like to purchase a domain and connect it to one of these templates (but this is not necessary)</p>

				<p>You should receive a code from wix.com at the email associated with your wix account. This code needs to be entered at your domain name registrar. See these detailed steps according to your registrar, . If you have ur domain at another platform, search "Transfer domain to [<em>name of domain registrar</em>]", it should be relatively straightforward.</p>
